# 📌 Week 1: Problem Definition & Topic Finalization  

## 🔍 Problem Statement  

Banks conduct direct marketing campaigns through telemarketing calls to promote term deposits. These campaigns require significant time, effort, and financial resources. However, contacting customers who are unlikely to subscribe reduces campaign efficiency and increases operational costs.

The goal of this project is to analyze historical marketing campaign data and build a predictive statistical model that identifies customers who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit. By understanding key influencing factors, financial institutions can improve campaign targeting, increase conversion rates, and optimize marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Research Questions  

1. Which customer attributes significantly influence term deposit subscription?
2. Does previous campaign outcome impact future subscription probability?
3. Can logistic regression effectively predict customer subscription behavior?
4. How can insights from data improve future marketing campaigns?

## 📂 Dataset  

We are using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** available on Kaggle.  

- Source: Kaggle – Bank Marketing Dataset  
- Original Study: Moro et al. (2014)  
- Context: Direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution  

The dataset contains demographic information, campaign-related attributes, and a binary target variable (`y`) indicating whether the client subscribed to a term deposit.

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection and Hypothesis Development  
4. Logistic Regression Modeling  
5. Model Evaluation and Validation  
6. Development of a Simple Python Application
